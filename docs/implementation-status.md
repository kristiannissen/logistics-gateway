## Pickup scheduling

| Feature | PostNord | Bring | GLS | GLS NL | DAO | DHL Express | DHL eCom EU | DHL eCom UK | DPD | Hermes | FedEx | InPost |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Book pickup** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ⚠️ | ❓ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ PL only |
| **Update pickup** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❓ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Cancel pickup** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❓ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ PL only |
| **Pickup availability** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❓ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |

**PostNord pickup note:** `POST /v3/pickups/ids` (domestic DK/SE/FI, requires item IDs from booking response) is now wired via `BookPickup`. Update/cancel pickup and manifest close are confirmed carrier limitations — no such endpoints exist. `GetCutoffTime` (`PickupQuerier`, not yet implemented) remains a genuine gap: `POST /v4/sac/pickup/stopdate` exists but returns a single cutoff date rather than a slot list, so it doesn't fulfil `GetPickupAvailability` either — that method is a confirmed limitation, distinct from the `GetCutoffTime` gap.
**DHL Express pickup note:** Implicit at booking (returns `dispatchConfirmationNumber`). Standalone `POST /api/pickups` not yet wired.
**GLS pickup note:** `POST /rs/sporadiccollection` is wired via `BookPickup`. Update/cancel/availability return `ErrNotSupported` — no such endpoints exist in the ShipIT API spec.
**GLS NL pickup note:** `POST /CreatePickup` — requires three address blocks; all default to the single pickup address when only one is provided.
**Hermes pickup note:** `POST`/`DELETE /pickuporders` are wired via `BookPickup`/`CancelPickup`. `GetPickupByID` and `ListPickups` (`PickupQuerier`) are also wired — the API has no per-ID GET or pagination, so both fetch the full `GET /pickuporders` list and filter/page client-side. `UpdatePickup`, `GetPickupAvailability`, and `GetCutoffTime` are confirmed carrier limitations — no such endpoints exist anywhere in the HSI API.
**FedEx pickup note:** Update not supported — cancel-and-rebook. Confirmation number is an opaque token encoding code + date + Express location.

## Manifest / end-of-day

| Carrier | Manifest close | Manifest document | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| PostNord | ❌ | ❌ | Handled by EDI scan at collection |
| Bring | ❌ | ❌ | No API support |
| GLS | ✅ | ❌ | **Required** — `POST /rs/shipments/endofday` wired via `CloseManifest`. Account-wide by date; must be called before driver arrives. No manifest document field in the response schema. |
| GLS NL | ✅ | ❌ | Per-unit `POST /ConfirmLabel` — CloseManifest iterates over all tracking numbers. No manifest PDF. |
| DAO | ❌ | ❌ | No API support |
| DHL Express | ❌ | ✅ | Post-collection only via `GET /shipments/{id}/get-image?typeCode=MANIFEST` |
| DHL eCommerce EU | ❓ | ❓ | Not confirmed |
| DHL eCommerce UK | ❌ | ❌ | No manifest API — shipments processed automatically by DHL |
| DPD | ❌ | ❌ | No API support — pickup order acts as handover instruction |
| Hermes | ❌ | ❌ | No end-of-day manifest endpoint exists anywhere in the HSI API — confirmed carrier limitation |
| FedEx | ✅ | ✅ | Ground only — `PUT /ship/v1/endofday/`. Express accounts do not require a close. |
| InPost | N/A | N/A | Locker network — no manifest |

## Add-ons

| Add-on | PostNord | Bring | GLS | GLS NL | DAO | DHL Express | DHL eCom EU | DHL eCom UK | DPD | Hermes | FedEx | InPost |

**DHL eCom EU `flex_delivery` and `signature_required`** are accepted but silently skipped — logged as warnings. Marked ⚠️ until properly wired.

**DHL eCom UK email notification** is automatic when `consigneeAddress.email` is set — DHL sends pre-delivery notifications without an explicit add-on mapping. Marked ⚠️.

## Developer experience

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Built-in docs (`GET /docs`) | ✅ | Endpoint index + freight terminology glossary. No external docs required. |

| Terminology glossary (`GET /docs/terminology`) | ✅ | 16 freight terms (COD, POD, AWB, Incoterms, HS Code, IOSS, de minimis, VAS, etc.) with one-line and extended definitions. |
| Plain-text terminal output | ✅ | Send `Accept: text/plain` for curl-help-style output — term names left-aligned, definitions inline. |
| Decoupled payloads | ✅ | Example JSON bodies are shown separately from their curl commands so they can be copied directly into any HTTP client. |

## Priority gaps

Issues that affect production operations and should be addressed next.

1. **FedEx label reprint** — `FetchLabel` returns `ErrNotSupported`. Labels
   must be stored from the booking response. Spec review pending.

2. **FedEx COD** — `shipmentCODDetail` is wired but FedEx only supports COD on
   Ground services. Express shipments with `AddOnCashOnDelivery` will be
   rejected by FedEx at the API level.

3. **DHL Express standalone pickup management** — `POST /api/pickups` for DHL
   Express is not wired; pickup is currently triggered only via the booking
   call. `PATCH /pickups` (update) and `DELETE /pickups/{id}` (cancel) also
   exist in the MyDHL API but are not wired — a previous version of this doc
   and the corresponding feature-mapping doc wrongly claimed these two were
   already implemented via `ManifestAdapter`; `DHLExpressAdapter` does not
   implement that interface at all.

3b. **PostNord pickup cutoff time** — `POST /v4/sac/pickup/stopdate` exists
    in the PostNord API (domestic DK/SE/FI) but is not wired to `GetCutoffTime`
    (`PickupQuerier`) in `internal/adapter/postnord.go`; that interface is not
    yet implemented at all. `BookPickup` itself is now wired via
    `/v3/pickups/ids` — this gap only affects the optional pre-flight cutoff
    check, not pickup booking itself.

4. **InPost go-live** — set `INPOST_CLIENT_ID`, `INPOST_CLIENT_SECRET`, `INPOST_ORG_ID`
   and run integration tests against `stage-api.inpost-group.com` before switching to
   production. Adapter is fully implemented.

5. **DPD tracking** — `GET /shipments/{id}` returns a numeric internal status
   code only. Full event tracking requires the separate DPD Tracking API
   (separate credentials).

6. **DHL eCommerce UK — cancellation postal code** — `CancelShipment` requires
   the consignee postal code alongside the shipment ID, but the `CarrierAdapter`
   interface only exposes the tracking number. The adapter caches the postal code
   at booking time; shipments booked in a different process or after a restart
   cannot be cancelled via the API. Resolve by storing the postal code externally
   (e.g. in the order database) and injecting it, or by extending the interface.

7. **DHL eCommerce UK — Windsor Framework (GB → NI)** — shipments from Great
   Britain to Northern Ireland require a `clearanceDeclaration` block
   (`C2C`/`C2B`/`B2C`/`B2B` Green/Red Lane). No `Customs` fields map to this
   yet. Must be added before routing GB→NI lanes through this adapter.

8. **DHL eCommerce UK — amendment** — `UpdateShipment` returns 501. The
   `/shipping/v1/amendment` endpoint supports post-booking address and weight
   changes but its schema is incompatible with `UpdateRequest`. Wire when the
   interface is extended.
