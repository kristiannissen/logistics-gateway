# PostNord — Feature Mapping

API: **PostNord Customer API**
Base URL (prod): `https://api2.postnord.com`
Auth: API key (query parameter `?apikey=`) + customer number + application ID
Coverage: Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland — single API key across all four markets.
Implementation status: **Production** — all five core `CarrierAdapter` methods
are live, so every primary method is complete. `internal/adapter/postnord.go`
now also implements `ManifestAdapter`: BookPickup is wired via
`/v3/pickups/ids` (domestic SE, DK, FI only — NO is a confirmed limitation
for this specific endpoint, even though PostNord otherwise covers NO for
booking/tracking/labels). UpdatePickup, CancelPickup, CloseManifest, and
GetPickupAvailability all return `ErrNotSupported` — no such endpoints exist
in the PostNord API. The carrier does not yet implement `PickupQuerier`;
`GetCutoffTime` is a genuine remaining secondary gap since
`/v4/sac/pickup/stopdate` exists but is not wired — per CLAUDE.md, secondary-tier
gaps (label retrieval, pickup scheduling) no longer block Production, so this
gap is tracked as a real limitation for pre-flight cutoff checks without
holding back the status label.

## Summary

PostNord is the most fully integrated carrier in the gateway. All five core
`CarrierAdapter` methods are live. It is the only carrier with native
idempotency key support. Pickup scheduling (`BookPickup`) is now wired for
domestic DK/SE/FI shipments via `/v3/pickups/ids`. Update/cancel of a
scheduled pickup and manifest close are confirmed carrier limitations — no
such endpoints exist. `GetCutoffTime` (`PickupQuerier`) remains unwired
despite `/v4/sac/pickup/stopdate` existing — a genuine secondary gap tracked
below, not yet blocking day-to-day pickup use since callers can submit
`BookPickup` directly without a pre-flight cutoff check.

## Feature fit/gap

### Booking

| Feature | Implemented | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Book shipment | ✅ | v3 EDI API, multi-colli, full address block. Returns `CarrierMessageID` for later reuse on update. |
| Cancel shipment | ✅ | v3 EDI cancel instruction (`messageFunction: "Cancellation"`, `updateIndicator: "Delete"`). See "Unconfirmed source" note below — a single low-confidence source disputes this, but it hasn't been acted on. |
| Update shipment | ✅ (partial) | Phone and email only. Weight and service point change are not supported post-booking. Per `APIdocs/postnord_update_cancel.rtf`, update is documented as SE-only for *all* fields, not just address changes, and the update instruction should reuse the exact `messageId` from the original booking — pass `BookingResponse.CarrierMessageID` back as `UpdateRequest.CarrierMessageID`. |
| Idempotency key | ✅ | Native — passed to the v3 EDI API directly |

### Labels

| Feature | Implemented | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Print label | ✅ | PDF format via v3 label endpoint |
| Return label | ✅ | `DeliveryType=return` triggers return booking |
| Label format | ✅ | PDF |
| ZPL | ⚠️ | Code path exists (`/rest/shipment/v3/edi/labels/zpl`) but not validated against live PostNord API |

### Tracking

| Feature | Implemented | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Current status | ✅ | v5 trackandtrace — normalized status |
| Event history | ✅ | Scan events returned in `events[]` |
| Estimated delivery | ✅ | `estimatedDelivery` populated where carrier returns it |

### Pickup scheduling

| Feature | Implemented | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Book pickup | ✅ | `POST /v3/pickups/ids` — takes carrier item IDs from `BookingResponse`/`ColliResponse.TrackingNumber`, not human-readable order references. Returns `bookingResponse.bookingId` as `ConfirmationNumber`. |
| Update pickup | ❌ | Confirmed carrier limitation — `/v3/pickups/ids` only exposes `POST` (create); no update endpoint exists (`501`) |
| Cancel pickup | ❌ | Confirmed carrier limitation — no cancel endpoint exists (`501`) |
| Pickup availability | ❌ | Confirmed carrier limitation for `GetPickupAvailability` specifically — no endpoint returns a list of bookable slots (`501`) |
| Get cutoff time | ❌ | Genuine gap, not a limitation — `POST /v4/sac/pickup/stopdate` exists and returns a cutoff/stop date but is not wired to `GetCutoffTime` (`PickupQuerier`, not yet implemented by this adapter) |
| Get pickup by ID / list pickups | ❌ | Confirmed carrier limitation — no such query endpoints exist in the API; `PickupQuerier` is not implemented |
| Geographic scope | ⚠️ | Domestic DK, SE, FI only for pickup booking. NO is rejected client-side (see `postNordPickupCountries` in `internal/adapter/postnord.go`). Cross-border PostNord shipments return `not_supported`. |

### Manifest

| Feature | Implemented | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Close manifest | ❌ | Confirmed carrier limitation — handled by EDI scan at collection time, no API endpoint (`501`) |
| Manifest document | ❌ | Not available via API |

### Add-ons

| Add-on | Implemented | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| SMS notification | ✅ | Mapped to PostNord `additionalServiceCode`. Requires `receiver.phone`. |
| Email notification | ✅ | Mapped to PostNord `additionalServiceCode`. Requires `receiver.email`. |
| Flex delivery | ✅ | Mapped to `additionalServiceCode` with instructions |
| Signature required | ✅ | `additionalServiceCode "A2"` |
| Insurance | ✅ | `additionalServiceCode "A8"`. Requires `insuranceValue > 0`. |
| Cash on delivery | ❌ | Not supported by PostNord API |

### Other features

| Feature | Implemented | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Customs / cross-border | ✅ | v3 EDI customs block — HS code, EORI, VAT, Incoterms, items |
| Service point delivery | ✅ | `receiver.servicePointId` → `servicePointId` in EDI |
| Multi-colli | ✅ | Multiple colli per booking, each gets its own tracking number |
| Business delivery | ✅ | `DeliveryType=business` |

## Endpoint mapping

| carrier-gateway | PostNord API | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/bookings` | v3 EDI create | ✅ |
| `DELETE /api/bookings/{id}` | v3 EDI cancel | ✅ |
| `PATCH /api/bookings/{id}` | v3 EDI update | ✅ (phone, email only) |
| `GET /api/trackings/{id}` | v5 trackandtrace | ✅ |
| `GET /api/labels/{id}` | v3 label | ✅ |
| `POST /api/pickups` | `/v3/pickups/ids` | ✅ |
| `PUT /api/pickups/{id}` | — (no update endpoint) | ❌ → 501 |
| `DELETE /api/pickups/{id}` | — (no cancel endpoint) | ❌ → 501 |
| `POST /api/manifests` | — (no manifest endpoint) | ❌ → 501 |

## Implementation notes

**Pickup now wired.** `internal/adapter/postnord.go` implements
`ManifestAdapter`. `BookPickup` calls `POST /v3/pickups/ids` with the carrier
item IDs from the booking response (not human-readable tracking numbers,
passed via `PickupRequest.TrackingNumbers`), and returns
`bookingResponse.bookingId` as `ConfirmationNumber`. Domestic SE, DK, FI
only — a request with `Address.Country` set to anything else (e.g. `NO`) is
rejected before the API call, since PostNord's own documentation limits this
endpoint to those three markets.
`UpdatePickup`, `CancelPickup`, and `CloseManifest` return `ErrNotSupported`
— no such endpoints exist anywhere in the PostNord Booking API. `GetPickupAvailability`
also returns `ErrNotSupported`: no endpoint returns a list of bookable time slots.

**Pickup cutoff — still a genuine gap.** `POST /v4/sac/pickup/stopdate`
returns a single cutoff/stop date (not a slot list), which maps to
`GetCutoffTime` on the `PickupQuerier` interface rather than
`GetPickupAvailability` on `ManifestAdapter`. This adapter does not yet
implement `PickupQuerier` at all, so `GetCutoffTime` remains unwired despite
the endpoint existing — a genuine secondary gap, not a carrier limitation.
Per CLAUDE.md's classification rule, secondary-tier gaps like this one no
longer block Production — it's tracked here as a real, worth-fixing gap for
pre-flight cutoff checks, not as something holding back the status label.

**Multi-market.** The same API key works for DK, SE, NO, FI. Routing is
determined by the sender/receiver country in the booking payload. No per-country
credential switching is required.

**Update messageId reuse (`APIdocs/postnord_update_cancel.rtf`).** PostNord's
documentation states that update instructions must reuse the exact `messageId`
from the original booking request — not a freshly generated one. Since this
gateway is stateless, `BookShipment` returns the messageId it used as
`BookingResponse.CarrierMessageID`; callers who need to update a PostNord
shipment later should store this value and pass it back as
`UpdateRequest.CarrierMessageID`. If omitted, `UpdateShipment` still generates
a new messageId on a best-effort basis (previous behavior), which PostNord's
API may reject for an existing shipment per this source.

**Update is SE-only for all fields, not just address.** The same source states
the update capability as a whole — not only address changes — is currently
only supported for Sweden. The adapter cannot validate this proactively (no
country is derivable from a bare tracking number in a stateless call), so it
still relies on the carrier rejecting DK/NO/FI update attempts at the API
level, same as before — this is a documentation correction, not a behavior
change.

**Cancel endpoint — unconfirmed discrepancy, not acted on.** The same RTF
claims PostNord's Booking API has no dedicated cancel/void endpoint at all,
recommending the Delivery Order Modification Service (DOMS) or manual
support instead. This directly contradicts the adapter's existing, working
`CancelShipment` (an EDI instruction with `messageFunction: "Cancellation"`,
`updateIndicator: "Delete"`). The source is a single AI-research summary with
no schema for the EDI Instruction format to cross-check either claim against,
and gives no endpoint or schema for DOMS to implement even if it's right.
Not acted on — flagged in code and here for awareness only.
