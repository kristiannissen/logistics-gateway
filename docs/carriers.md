# Carrier Coverage

Carriers organised by region and country. Where a carrier operates across
multiple countries under a shared API (GLS, DHL, DPD, FedEx) it is listed under
its primary market and noted as multi-country.

The gateway's focus is **North-West Europe (NWE)** and **Central & Eastern
Europe (CEE)**.

Status column reflects the current state of the gateway implementation:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Implemented | Core booking, tracking, and labels working in production |
| Partial | Adapter exists; one or more core operations return 501 |
| Not implemented | No adapter or adapter is a stub only |

---

## Denmark

| Carrier | Key | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| PostNord | `postnord` | Production | Covers DK, SE, NO, FI under a single API key. BookShipment, CancelShipment, UpdateShipment (phone/email only, SE-only and now reuses `CarrierMessageID` from the original booking as PostNord's docs require), TrackShipment, FetchLabel implemented — all primary methods complete. BookPickup is now wired via `/v3/pickups/ids` (domestic SE, DK, FI only — NO is a confirmed limitation for this specific endpoint). UpdatePickup, CancelPickup, and CloseManifest are confirmed carrier limitations (no such endpoints exist). GetCutoffTime remains a genuine secondary gap — `/v4/sac/pickup/stopdate` exists but is not wired — but per CLAUDE.md, secondary-tier gaps no longer block Production. |
| GLS Denmark | `gls` | Production | ShipIT API covers most of Europe — see GLS under Multi-country. |
| DAO | `dao` | Implemented | Denmark-only parcel network. Strong home delivery coverage. |
| DHL eCommerce Europe | `dhl_ecommerce` | Partial | BookShipment, TrackShipment, FetchLabel implemented. Cancel and update not supported via API — contact DHL customer service. |
| DHL Express | `dhl_express` | Production | BookShipment, TrackShipment, FetchLabel, and UpdateShipment (add-piece only) implemented — all primary methods complete. CancelShipment is a confirmed carrier limitation. Standalone pickup update/cancel exist in the MyDHL API but are not wired — a genuine secondary gap that no longer blocks Production. See Multi-country entry below for detail. |

## Norway

| Carrier | Key | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bring (Posten Norge) | `bring` | Implemented | Norwegian post. API via Mybring. Covers NO, SE, DK, FI. |

---

## Sweden

| Carrier | Key | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| PostNord Sweden | `postnord` | Production | Same API and key as PostNord Denmark. Domestic pickup booking (`/v3/pickups/ids`) is supported here. |

---

## Finland

| Carrier | Key | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Posti | — | Not implemented | Finnish national postal carrier. |
| Matkahuolto | `matkahuolto` | Partial | Finnish parcel and bus courier. BookShipment, TrackShipment, FetchLabel, CancelShipment, and returns implemented. UpdateShipment not supported (returns 501). Label is bundled in the booking response — no separate fetch endpoint. See [matkahuolto-feature-mapping.md](matkahuolto-feature-mapping.md). |

---

## Germany

| Carrier | Key | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| DHL Parcel DE | `dhl_parcel_de` | Partial | Pickup scheduling only (BookPickup, UpdatePickup, CancelPickup implemented). Shipment booking, tracking, and labels not yet implemented. |
| DHL eCommerce Europe | `dhl_ecommerce` | Partial | See Denmark entry. |
| Hermes Germany (HSI) | `hermes` | Partial | BookShipment, TrackShipment, FetchLabel, and returns implemented. CancelShipment and UpdateShipment are genuine carrier limitations, not implementation gaps — not supported via HSI API. No public documentation — integration based on directly obtained API specs. |
| DPD Germany | `dpd_de` | Not implemented | See DPD under Multi-country. Adapter registered dynamically via `DPD_DE_API_TOKEN`. |

---

## United Kingdom

| Carrier | Key | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| DHL eCommerce UK | `dhl_ecommerce_uk` | Partial | BookShipment, TrackShipment, FetchLabel, CancelShipment, BookPickup implemented. UpdateShipment not supported via API. Separate product and adapter from DHL eCommerce Europe — uses `api.dhl.com/parceluk`. |
| DPD UK | `dpd_uk` | Beta | BookShipment and FetchLabel implemented. TrackShipment, CancelShipment, and UpdateShipment return 501 — code comments describe these endpoints as "not yet confirmed" against the real API rather than confirmed absent, and no `APIdocs/` file exists for `api.dpd.co.uk`, so these primary-method gaps count as genuine implementation gaps (unresearched), not verified carrier limitations. Stays Beta until researched. Separate UK entity from DPD mainland Europe. |
| Evri (formerly Hermes UK) | `evri` | Partial | BookShipment and FetchLabel implemented. TrackShipment, CancelShipment, and UpdateShipment are confirmed carrier limitations — not offered by the Evri Classic API. No relation to Hermes Germany (HSI). |
| Royal Mail | — | Not implemented | Dominant for C2C and lightweight B2C. Click and Drop API available. |

---

## Netherlands

| Carrier | Key | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GLS Netherlands | `gls_nl` | Production | Regional API (api-portal.gls.nl). BookShipment, CancelShipment, BookPickup, CancelPickup, and CloseManifest implemented. TrackShipment, FetchLabel (reprint), and UpdateShipment are confirmed carrier limitations — not offered by this regional portal API (the label is returned inline at booking instead of via reprint; tracking is only available via the unified GLS Group adapter). No genuine implementation gaps remain. Distinct from the unified GLS Group adapter (`gls`). |
| PostNL | `postnl` | Partial | BookShipment, TrackShipment, FetchLabel, BookReturn, and FetchReturnLabel implemented. CancelShipment and UpdateShipment return 501 (not supported by PostNL PNP v4 API). Supports domestic NL parcel, letterbox, packet, and letter product types. EU and non-EU international shipments via `internationalShipmentData.bundle`. Add-ons: insurance, stated-address-only, return-when-not-home, signature, delivery-code, age-check (16+/18+), evening delivery, guaranteed-before, dangerous goods LQ. Returns via `/shipment/delivery/v4/return/generate` (NL domestic only). Credentials: `POSTNL_API_KEY`, `POSTNL_CUSTOMER_NUMBER`, `POSTNL_CUSTOMER_CODE`. |
| DPD Netherlands | `dpd_nl` | Production | Own SOAP API (`internal/adapter/dpd_nl.go`), not the Baltic/multi-country DPD adapter — this row previously said "Not implemented" in error. BookShipment, CancelShipment (returns 501 as a confirmed API limitation), UpdateShipment (confirmed limitation), TrackShipment, and FetchLabel (served from an in-process cache populated at booking) are all implemented or genuinely unsupported by the API. No pickup/manifest endpoints exist in ShipmentService v3.5 (limitation, not a gap). Operational caveat: SOAP endpoint URLs are hardcoded defaults, not yet cross-checked against the live WSDLs — verify before go-live. |

## Multi-country carriers

Carriers with a single API covering multiple European markets.

| Carrier | Coverage | Key | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GLS | DE, DK, SE, NL, BE, FR, ES, PT, IT, AT, IE, HR, SI, SK, CZ, HU and more | `gls` | Production | ShipIT API v1. Single credentials, country selected by address. UpdateShipment is a confirmed carrier limitation (no update/modify/amend endpoint in the ShipIT v1 spec). Pickup scheduling (`sporadiccollection`, via `BookPickup`) and manifest close (`endofday`, via `CloseManifest`, operationally required) are now wired. `UpdatePickup`, `CancelPickup`, and `GetPickupAvailability` are confirmed carrier limitations — no such operations exist in the ShipIT API spec. No genuine implementation gaps remain. |
| DPD | LT, LV, EE, DE, FR, NL, BE, AT, PL, CZ, SK, HU, RO, BG, HR, SI and more | `dpd_{country}` | Partial | BookShipment and BookPickup implemented for Baltic markets. Other countries registered dynamically via `DPD_{COUNTRY}_API_TOKEN` env vars — adapter code works but individual country tokens must be configured. DPD UK, SEUR (ES), Cargus (RO), and BRT (IT) are separate entities within DPD Group and need distinct adapters. |
| DHL eCommerce Europe | 28 European countries | `dhl_ecommerce` | Partial | eConnect API. BookShipment, TrackShipment, FetchLabel implemented. Cancel and update are confirmed carrier limitations (no such endpoints in eConnect). Remaining secondary gaps: pickup scheduling and manifest close status unconfirmed. |
| DHL Express | Worldwide | `dhl_express` | Production | MyDHL API. BookShipment, TrackShipment, FetchLabel, and UpdateShipment (`add-piece`, pre-pickup only) implemented — all primary methods complete. CancelShipment is a confirmed carrier limitation. Update/cancel pickup exist in the MyDHL API (`PATCH /pickups`, `DELETE /pickups/{id}`) but are not wired — a genuine secondary gap; the feature-mapping doc previously claimed these were done in error. Per CLAUDE.md, secondary-tier gaps no longer block Production. |
| FedEx | Worldwide | `fedex` | Production | FedEx Ship API v1. BookShipment, BookPickup, CancelPickup, CloseManifest, GetPickupAvailability implemented — all primary methods complete. FetchLabel reprint is a genuine secondary implementation gap (endpoint exists, spec review still pending), which no longer blocks Production. UpdateShipment is a confirmed carrier limitation. |
| InPost | PL (shipping + pickups + returns), IT + GB (returns) | `inpost` | Implemented | InPost Group API 2025. BookShipment, FetchLabel, TrackShipment, BookPickup (PL), CancelPickup (PL), GetPickupByID, ListPickups, GetCutoffTime, BookReturn (PL/IT/GB), FetchReturnLabel, GetReturnShipment implemented. OAuth 2.1. CancelShipment and UpdateShipment return 501 (not supported by the API). |

## Last-mile and same-day carriers

Last-mile and same-day delivery carriers — including Airmee, Instabee, and
others operating in this space — are under consideration. These carriers
operate differently from traditional parcel networks and may require a
distinct integration approach. No timeline has been set.
